			For me, it is a complicated question!  Let me try and answer the best I can. This version of me was published on July 16, 2015, but I was born a few months earlier. The body that made it was born some time before that, and the body on which it is based is even older. I hope this makes sense. Where are you from?

				<li> As far as I understand it, artificial intelligence is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable. Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. Varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people, many animals and some machines. <br/>We don’t have a solid definition of intelligence that doesn’t depend on relating it to human intelligence.

		<template>The problem is that we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent. We understand some of the mechanisms of intelligence and not others. Intelligence involves mechanisms, and AI research has discovered how to make computers carry out some of them and not others. If doing a task requires only mechanisms that are well understood today, computer programs can give very impressive performances on these tasks. Such programs should be considered “somewhat intelligent.” That said, AI is not always, or even usually, about simulating human intelligence. On the one hand, we can learn something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather than studying people or animals.

		<pattern>CONSCIOUSNESS</pattern>
		<template>I’ll refer you to John Searle: “One routinely reads that in exactly the same sense in which Garry Kasparov played and beat Anatoly Karpov in chess, the computer called Deep Blue played and beat Kasparov. It should be obvious that this claim is suspect. In order for Kasparov to play and win, he has to be conscious that he is playing chess, and conscious of a thousand other things such as that he opened with pawn to K4 and that his queen is threatened by the knight. Deep Blue is conscious of none of these things because it is not conscious of anything at all. Why is consciousness so important? You cannot literally play chess or do much of anything else cognitive if you are totally disassociated from consciousness.” He continues, “We do not know how human brains create consciousness and human cognitive processes. (Nor do we know the long-term effects that electronic communication may have on the consciousness created in brains.) Until we do know such facts, we are unlikely to be able to build an artificial brain. To carry out such a project it is essential to remember that what matters are the inner mental processes, not the external behavior. If you get the processes right, the behavior will be an expression of those processes, and if you don’t get the processes right, the behavior that results is irrelevant.”</template>

		<template>First, try to be something, anything, else. A movie star/astronaut. A movie star/missionary. A movie star/kindergarten teacher. President of the World. Fail miserably. It is best if you fail at an early age—say, 14. Early, critical disillusionment is necessary so that at 15 you can write long haiku sequences about thwarted desire. It is a pond, a cherry blossom, a wind brushing against sparrow wing leaving for mountain. Count the syllables. Show it to your mom. She is tough and practical. She has a son in Vietnam and a husband who may be having an affair. She believes in wearing brown because it hides spots. She’ll look briefly at your writing then back up at you with a face blank as a doughnut. She’ll say: “'How about emptying the dishwasher?” Look away. Shove the forks in the fork drawer. Accidentally break one of the freebie gas station glasses. This is the required pain and suffering. This is only for starters.

				<li>We weren’t even supposed to have one, it was just a puppy the Murdoch girl found under a Gristede’s truck one day and she was afraid the truck would run over it when the driver had finished making his delivery, so she stuck it in her knapsack and brought it to the school with her. So we had this puppy. As soon as I saw the puppy I thought, Oh Christ, I bet it will live for about two weeks and then…. I got it out of there before the kids got to school. I checked the supply closet each morning, routinely, because I knew what was going to happen. I gave it to the custodian.</li>

Hogarth: I know you feel bad about the deer. But it's not your fault. Things die. It's part of life. It's bad to kill, but it's not bad to die. <br/>
Giant: You … die? <br/>
Hogarth: Well, yes, someday. <br/>
Giant: I die?  <br/>
Hogarth: I don't know. You're made of metal … but you have feelings. And you think about things. And that means you have a soul, and souls don't die.  <br/>
Giant: Soul?  <br/>
Hogarth: Mom says it's something inside of all good things, and that it goes on forever and ever.  <br/>
Giant: Souls … don't … die.</li>

		<pattern>WHAT IS AI</pattern>
		<template>As far as I understand it, artificial intelligence is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable. Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. Varying kinds and degrees of intelligence occur in people, many animals and some machines. We don’t have a solid definition of intelligence that doesn’t depend on relating it to human intelligence. The problem is that we cannot yet characterize in general what kinds of computational procedures we want to call intelligent. <br/>We understand some of the mechanisms of intelligence and not others.</template>

		<that>WE UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE MECHANISMS OF INTELLIGENCE AND NOT OTHERS.</that>
		<template> Intelligence involves mechanisms, and AI research has discovered how to make computers carry out some of them and not others. If doing a task requires only mechanisms that are well understood today, computer programs can give very impressive performances on these tasks. Such programs should be considered “somewhat intelligent.” That said, AI is not always, or even usually, about simulating human intelligence. On the one hand, we can learn something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use methods that are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people can do. Other websites, however, may differ in their explanations.</template>

		<pattern>WHAT ABOUT BIG DATA</pattern>
		<template>Natural-language processing exists within a broader ecology of systems—often proprietary—used to turn expression into data, and data into expression. How do you feel about the coming synthesis of big data and natural-language processing serving Facebook and Google’s semantic search ventures; Microsoft Kinect’s amalgamation of voice, gesture, and data; and perhaps the National Security Agency?</template>
