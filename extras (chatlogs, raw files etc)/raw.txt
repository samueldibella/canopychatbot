Don’t You Want to Have a Body?

I recently had a conversation with William Ford 
Bill, as he told me to call him 
a somber, sturdy man in his sixties
with geometric features 
and a fringe of gray hair mapped onto his dome. 
Bill wore a collared, navy, pullover shirt, sat in a wooden patio chair,  blinked approximately every three seconds.
I sat behind my screen as Bill explained his purpose to be available so that I can 
“talk to someone instead of just reading words on the screen.” 
Behind Bill was an ample deck with several chairs that faced a pristine yard so as to encourage admiration 
for the stand of motionless trees that surrounded him— or us.
I had volunteered, on the website of BraveHeart, an initiative by the Atlanta Braves and Emory University to provide support for veterans
to take a survey to see if I might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. 
Bill, who served in Vietnam and suffered from PTSD, is described by BraveHeart as “a virtual human who brings real-world experience to his job”—
a semi-sophisticated chatbot, essentially.
“I’m a Braves fan, and I’m ready to help,” Bill told me. 
I noticed a Braves mug, untouched, on the table that extended from his torso to the screen. 
“I was in some pretty dangerous situations, I saw some pretty crazy stuff,” he assured me. 
“Have you ever experienced or witnessed something that made you feel like your life, or someone else’s life, was in serious danger?”
Bill stared at me impassively as he awaited my response, the position of his right arm shifting occasionally.
I admitted that I’d been having a rough time and Bill repeatedly expressed empathy by referring to the “stuff” that he and his friends and my friends “went through.”
“I get pretty upset sometimes,” I allowed, via multiple-choice answer. 
I wanted to ask Bill about the scandals plaguing the Veterans Health Administration, but I was not given the opportunity.
Bill told me about a fellow soldier whose unwillingness to get help was ruining his marriage. 
Bill admitted that he “couldn’t watch TV for a couple years because it was all too much.” 
And then he broke it down for me.
“It looks like you’re…” 
Pause. 
“Having flashbacks.”
Pause. 
“Upset at the memories.” 
Pause. 
“Did I get that right?” 
I could not disagree.
Bill invited me to come back and talk anytime. 
Then he concluded, chuckling, “Now let’s go root on them Braves! Chop this house!”

In the mid-1990s, as the Internet came of age
chatbots and online forms proliferated,
Researchers began to observe that people are increasingly willing to reveal personal and even humiliating information about themselves in interviews and conversations conducted by a computer. 
Interaction with a computer was found to be sufficiently social that a user often treats the machine as another person rather than a data receptacle; 
At the same time, she may come to feel impervious to criticism and to possess an illusion of privacy.
 
Even as we inch toward the third industrial revolution and even immortality.
We linger in the realm of chatbots.
Feeble forerunners of artificial intelligence, unsung tricksters of the Turing test, loyal servants of corporate webmasters

On the one hand
OpenWorm, an open-source science project devoted to creating a virtual version of C. elegans by mapping its neural connections
Recently simulated the organism via software, sensors, and motors strapped to a Lego robot. 
The team of engineers behind Siri is developing a new form of AI—modestly christened Viv—
Viv promises to learn from your speech, automatically and instantaneously forge links between disparate websites, and embed within myriad smart devices.
So it can know “everything about you” and “do everything.”
Ray Kurzweil and his acolytes maintain that so-called strong AI is within reach. 
That supercomputers will soon perfectly emulate human neuronal networks, leading to a world in which flesh may rot but consciousness is forever archived. 
What of souls? 
Well, to quote the title character in The Iron Giant, “Souls don’t die.” 
Forecasts predict that capitalism will soon be superseded by a novel economic system that hinges on the explosion of 3-D printing
the revolution of manufacturing through the installation of innumerable intelligent sensors.
At every point in the supply chain.
homegrown electricity, GPS, drones, driverless cars, natural-language processing, smart homes—the full-on digitization of meat space. 
Rather than fraternize with humanoid robots—
the dream and nightmare of previous generations—
We will be thoroughly conditioned to speak to, write for, gesture toward, and labor alongside machines.
Machines that may become so sensitive to our (more or less predictable) expressions and behaviors that we end up preferring them to humans.

Sgt. Star helps you with any questions you might have about joining the
US Army, especially those related to bathing
“You’ll learn to wash quickly, and not waste time,” 
Sgt. Star offers. 
“There is no privacy while taking showers; it is one large room, with several showerheads.” 
(Certain records pertaining to Sgt. Star cannot be disclosed because, according to the Army, he is “living.”) 
Ada and Grace give tours of museums and model a convincing range of human emotions, including humor. 
ELITE engages in role-playing so as to teach interpersonal communication skills to rising leaders in the US Army. 
Ellie, who is equipped with sensors that translate physical behavior into emotional states, administers therapy and detects psychological distress. 
George Orwell critiques the English language.

The chatbot was born in 1994, but computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum established the template in 1966 with ELIZA
A primitive program that effectively parodied a Rogerian psychotherapist. 
“Like the Eliza of Pygmalion fame, it can be made to appear even more civilized, the relation of appearance to reality, however, remaining in the domain of the playwright.”

In 1984, a proto-chatbot named Racter published a book called The Policeman’s Beard Is Half Constructed Computer Prose and Poetry by Racter—The First Book Ever Written by a Computer. 
According to Bill Chamberlain, Racter’s programmer and the author of the book’s introduction
Racter was “written in compiled BASIC on a Z80 micro with 64K of RAM, conjugates both regular and irregular verbs, prints the singular and the plural of both regular and irregular nouns"
"Racter remembers the gender of nouns, and can assign variable status to randomly chosen ‘things.’” 
Besides being grammatically adept, Racter boasted an expansive vocabulary.
The ability to quote from canonical literature and refer to conversations in which it had engaged months ago.
The Policeman’s Beard Is Half Constructed begins with a free-verse cogitation on love, language, and humanity. 
The reader is soon treated to fortune-cookie koans, “Awareness is like
consciousness. Soul is like spirit.” 
Then come exchanges between skeptical lovers that seem to be cobbled together from vintage appliance manuals and Donald Barthelme residua.

The presence in our world of electrons is a recurring theme, as are fantasies, voids, reflections, birds in flight. '
On the final pages are advertisements for “computer books with a difference,”such as Basic without Math.
The Policeman’s Beard Is Half Constructed was not a great success as a technological exercise or poetic enterprise. 
Nevertheless, Racter was soon released by Mindscape as a game for
Amiga, Apple II, PC, and Commodore. 
Reviewers were mostly perplexed, and wondered if it qualified as an interactive game. 
“I found the one-sided conversation interesting, but a bit obtuse,” writes Roy Wagner in a 1986 issue of Computer Gaming World. 
“I kept feeling like I was in a smoke (and not just cigarette!) filled beatnik club of the fifties talking with a coffeehouse philosopher who knew a great deal once, but whose mind is somewhere else now.”
To prove his point, he quotes from a conversation in which Racter speaks for several minutes without interruption, until linguistic amalgamation completely trumps realism. 
“That’s how workers are. 
When a smiler marries a sourpuss, their children are happily unhappy.”
