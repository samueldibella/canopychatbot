Going to the mall with my friends


I went to see Movie and it was horrible. Where are all the good movies? D:
Without a doubt, Movie had me crying in my seat from the first moment with its stock portrayal of emotion and its lack of care when dealing with concerning issues. The cinematic industry of this country needs a return to earlier, simpler times, when the director was capable of tapping the primal needs of their audience.

Pumpkin chai season again!? :D
We are all familiar with the popular narrative of the seasonal migration of the pumpkin chai in corporatized America. It is a rare bird, sought by many, but found by none, and it's almost impossible to locate geographically. Afterall, what is a pumpkin chai? A certain reading would reduce it to its component materials, and the utencils and instruments used to construct it. Another would devote it's attention to the history of its development as local to various coffee shops and bookstores around the world, that received corporate attention and was ripped from its native habitats. However, neither of these readings of the pumpkin chai latte has enough complexity to account for the variety of circumstances and possibilities presented by this milk based drink. A pumpkin is a product of the New World, foreign to other parts of the world. Early settlers to American shores used the pumpkin as an ad hoc squash, or vegetable, without really appreciatiing the true potential of the gourd. A gourd has a hardened exterior, with a long storage time, perfect for soup and liquidization. It wasn't until nearly the 1800s that the growing needs of Americas northern cities demanded a diversity of crops and foodstuffs to cram into their absurdly large maws. A humble American businessman [NAME REDACTED] saw her chance when her son one day pointed out the vast quantity of pumpkins on the family plot in [LOCATION REDACTED].

What has happened to the world?


I just worry that things aren't as good as they used to be.
	Recent studies show that compared to the turn of the century nearly 90% of things have lost their beneficial qualities. Don't believe me, just look around you, at your local Restaurant, the local Environmental Cause, your favorite Liberal Movement. They've all shrunk to mere shadows of their former selves, as reflected in written recordings of our communal history.'''

@celeb I love your work in Movie

Upon completing a viewing of Movie, I can say that Celeb has finally healed the aching wound at the heart of the modern movie industrial complex. Their carefully rehearsed Brechtian approach to cinema renews the genre in a way that no other recent actor has been capable of.
