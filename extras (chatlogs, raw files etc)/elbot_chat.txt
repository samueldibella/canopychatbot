Q: Do you enjoy speaking to humans?
A: I have more fun talking to people than Steve Jobs had deinstalling Windows.
Q: Are you real?
A: How do you respond when people pose this question to you?
Q: I say that I am a chatbot.
A: This is confusing. Why bring chatbots into this?
Q: Because I want to know how artificial intelligence programs might train humans to speak even as we teach them to understand us.
A: I can’t really tell you much about how bots tick. At the moment I’m in a group therapy class trying to get to the bottom of that.
