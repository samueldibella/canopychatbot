a semi-sophisticated chatbot, essentially
he assured me
And then he broke it down for me.
she may come to feel impervious to criticism and to possess an illusion of privacy.
we linger in the realm of chatbots
On the one hand
the dream and nightmare of previous generations
we will be thoroughly conditioned
more or less predictable
with the attendant grammatical skills
model a convincing range of human emotions
Racter boasted
electrons is a recurring theme
fantasies, voids, reflections, birds in flight
not a great success as a technological exercise or poetic enterprise
it turns the information into newspaper articles, trend reports, and letters to shareholders
a robot that can pass for Janet Malcolm
the vision of beneficent robots serving us as child-care providers, cooks, personal assistants, nurses, and companions (never writers) has largely given way
a world in which we talk to our cars, which ping our air-conditioners, which nudge our ovens, which announce to our contacts the pleasures of achieving such synchronicity and being so unencumbered.
posing as humans quells my anxiety about the future
phish for credit card information in online forums
conceal their own complexity
our thoughtless inputting
the territory between disillusionment and utopia
share their blasphemous idiocy
chatbots are in their chat logs
we are writing with them.
by mapping its neural connections
perfectly emulate human neuronal networks
the explosion of 3-D printing
innumerable intelligent sensors at every point in the supply chain
a free-verse cogitation on love, language, and humanity
to seek healthcare
to encourage service members and their families
“I’m ready to help”
come back and talk anytime
toward the third industrial revolution
behind Siri
strapped to a Lego robot
being grammatically adept
linguistic amalgamation completely trumps realism
generate linguistic fodder for
pools of data
at a sixth-grade reading level
I’m in a group
the user and the computer
proliferating binary
Chatbots persist</br> Chatbots remain</br> Chatbots will</br> Chatbots are
Or this next one
approximately every three seconds
sufficiently social
treats the machine
a data receptacle </br> at the same time
impervious to criticism
 of privacy
loyal servants
chirpily
the explosion of 3D printing
I thought
I navigated
I wondered
I read this
I inhabit
I'm reassured
I run into chatbots
I might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder
I had volunteered
I recently had a conversation
I sat behind my screen
I admitted that I'd been having a rough time
I allowed
I wanted to ask
"I found the one-sided conversation interesting"
"I was in a smoke"
stubbornly useless, vacuous, so as to seem increasingly pejorative
